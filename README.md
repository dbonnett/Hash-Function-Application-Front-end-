# Hash Function Application

This interactive front-end application will allow the user to toggle different parameters and see how the 'collision' rate of a hash table is affected by different hashing algorithms. 

The intended use is mostly educational; to provide the user a sense of how hashing functions work and how different functions produce different levels of 'randomness'.
